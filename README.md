# delivery-service

This is a project related to start up idea, where the idea is implemented using php and Sql database.

The idea behind the project is that, as in our day to day activities we all are busy doing our jobs but 
if instead of relying on a courier service for letters and parcels, we want our courier to send to a person
within small period of time and with security.
Then a new scheme which is thought is, half money is paid to person from the area where the parcel is to
pick and half money will be paid by the person to whom the parcel is to delivered.
Thus, the idea behind is to pay, to pick and drop……
Thus, pick the product and drop from door to door.
